## Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about our project contributor ladder! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows.  Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do. "Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.


### Community Participant
Description: A Community Participant engages with the project and its community, contributing their time, thoughts, etc. Community participants are usually users who have stopped being anonymous and started being active in project discussions.

* Responsibilities:
    * Must follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* How users can get involved with the community:
    * Participating in community discussions
    * Helping other users
    * Submitting bug reports
    * Commenting on issues
    * Trying out new releases
    * Attending community events


### Contributor
Description: A Contributor contributes directly to the project and adds value to it. Contributions need not be code. People at the Contributor level may be new contributors, or they may only contribute occasionally.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Follow the code of conduct
    * Follow the project contributing guide
* Requirements (one or several of the below):
    * Report and sometimes resolve issues
    * Occasionally submit PRs
    * Contribute to the documentation
    * Show up at meetings, takes notes
    * Answer questions from other community members
    * Submit feedback on issues and PRs
    * Test releases and patches and submit reviews
    * Run or helps run events
    * Promote the project in public
    * Help run the project infrastructure
* Privileges:
    * Invitations to contributor events

### Maintainer
Description: Maintainers are very established contributors who are responsible for the entire project. As such, they have the ability to approve PRs against any area of the project, and are expected to participate in making decisions about the strategy and priorities of the project.

A Maintainer must meet the responsibilities and requirements of a Reviewer, plus:

* Responsibilities include:
    * Reviewing at least 15 PRs per year, especially PRs that involve multiple parts of the project
    * Mentoring new Reviewers
    * Writing refactoring PRs
    * Participating in CNCF maintainer activities
    * Determining strategy and policy for the project
    * Participating in, and leading, community meetings
* Requirements
    * Experience as a Reviewer for at least 4 months
    * Demonstrates a broad knowledge of the project across multiple areas
    * Is able to exercise judgment for the good of the project, independent of their employer, friends, or team
    * Mentors other contributors
    * Can commit to spending at least 24 hours per month working on the project
* Additional privileges:
    * Approve PRs to any area of the project
    * Represent the project in public as a Maintainer
    * Have a vote in Maintainer decision-making meetings
    

Process of becoming a maintainer:
1. Any current Maintainer may nominate a current Reviewer to become a new Maintainer, by opening a PR against the root of the repository adding the nominee as an Approver in the OWNERS file.
2. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
3. A majority of the current Maintainers must then approve the PR.

## Inactivity
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than 3 months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than 3 months
* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
